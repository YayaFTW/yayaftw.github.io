                    <strong><span class="red">Amidst the crowded loud café silence reigned</span></strong>,
                    <br/>For a second so brief yet so eternal it pained
                    <br/>
                    <br/> My other half grew weary of my hollow words and vows,
                    <br/> My godsent grew jaded from my incessant whens and hows
                    <br/>
                    <br/> Aïcha is unfailingly right, that day was no oddity,
                    <br/> I wish I was as sage, I covet her wisdom and clarity
                    <br/>
                    <br/> For she was right. My whens and hows were but a mere excuse,
                    <br/> No reason was proper, No intention I had to confuse
                    <br/>
                    <br/> A customary man is but a fruit of many flavors and stripes,
                    <br/> And through time, just as the man grows, the fruit ripes
                    <br/>
                    <br/> A love red cherry, is savored tender before the essence festers,
                    <br/> As should a prime man act his words before their worth falters
                    <br/>
                    <br/> I itch for this poem to reach your affection and kindness,
                    <br/> For I refuse to settle this matter with a taste of bitterness
                    <br/>
                    <br/> I would convey you, queen of my soul to yield me one last chance,
                    <br/> That would be of no use, not a soul could hinder our romance
                    <br/>
                    <br/> Thus I instead become the all luscious cherry of your liking,
                    <br/> A cherry you can relish, that no other would dream of taking
                    <br/>
                    <br/> Know that my thoughtless actions are regretted and dearly,
                    <br/> And the way I was impetuous to you troubles my sleep nightly
                    <br/>
                    <br/> For my love for you is a warm, graceful and respectful love,
                    <br/> A love that I pray day and night to be blessed from above
                    <br/>
                    <br/> I love you in and out and from head to toe till we die old,
                    <br/> You are the angel I'd ever embrace, the hand I'd ever hold.

                    <strong><span class="red">My eyes were blind, my words were not kind</span></strong>,
                    <br/>I was unable to soothe Aïcha's uneasy mind
                    <br/>
                    <br/> From the fear that looms behind the future's mystery,
                    <br/> From the lessons of the past, and their aching misery
                    <br/>
                    <br/> My temper, from my will and reason it stands apart,
                    <br/> And thus I could not nurse my hero's soft and frail heart
                    <br/>
                    <br/> But now that my soul is serene,that my thoughts are bright,
                    <br/> Through this poem I wish to tell you, Aïcha my light
                    <br/>
                    <br/> That our mesmerizing days, our future lies within,
                    <br/> The roots of the seeds we plant and believe in
                    <br/>
                    <br/> With a heart beating hard and eyes staring in awe,
                    <br/> With eternal true love, a love that has no flaw
                    <br/>
                    <br/> As my hand moans from the warmth of your skin,
                    <br/> As your beauty and purity melt me from within
                    <br/>
                    <br/> At the sight of your eyes, those pearls I adore,
                    <br/> Your trust, your will and your bravery I implore
                    <br/>
                    <br/> Let us hand in hand build the dreams of our future at last,
                    <br/> Let my undying love for you veil the history of the past.
